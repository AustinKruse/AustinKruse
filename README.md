<h2>About</h2>
I've been in Tech Support for years & I'm aspiring to focus soley on Cybersecurity.  I have been following cybersecurity since IRC was the main chat, and I've just hit a point in my life where I want to do something in which my skillset is utilized.  

My cybersecurity experience consists of CompTIA Security+ & Linux Essentials Certifications, College Classes, Home Labs, & [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/TaqTix).  I enjoy playing video games, paintball, sports, and hacking!
